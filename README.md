# Report Tweaks - Redcap External Module

## What does it do?

Report tweaks adds options to hide redcap generated columns, merge rows from the same record, hide empty rows, and add "writeback" buttons to reports that allow for flags or action dates to be set on all records in a report. 

## Installing

This EM isn't yet available to install via redcap's EM database so you'll need to install to your modules folder (i.e. `redcap/modules/report_tweaks_v1.0.0`) manually.

## Configuration

Configuration is done on the edit report screen under a new "Report Tweaks" section. Some settings can also be toggled on the report itself.

## Call Outs

* None
